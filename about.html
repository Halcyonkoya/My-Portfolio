    <h2>Personal Experiences</h2>
<p>
    Over the past few years, I have worked on several web development projects, both independently and as part of a team. One of my most rewarding experiences was building a responsive e-commerce website for a local business, where I handled everything from the initial design to deployment. This project taught me the importance of user experience, accessibility, and performance optimization. I also recently graduated from an advanced frontend certification course, where I honed my skills in modern JavaScript frameworks like React and Vue.js. This course provided me with a solid understanding of component-based architecture and state management, which I have applied in my recent projects.
</p>
<p>
    I have also contributed to open-source projects on GitHub, collaborating with developers worldwide and learning best practices in version control and code reviews. These experiences have strengthened my problem-solving skills and deepened my understanding of modern web technologies.
